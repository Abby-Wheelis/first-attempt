    Environmental Conservation

<p>
The planet that we live on is suffering from extensive pollution and damage brought on by humanity. It is important that we start to be more mindful and careful of the impact that our actions have on the environment so that we may preserve it for many years to come. These actions and thoughts do not have to be difficult or complicated, but they are necessary.

    This cause is something that I care deeply about because the time that I have spent outdoors has produce many of my favorite memories. These include time spent with family, new adventures with friends, and a sense of calm that is hard to find elsewhere.

    There are many small steps that we can all take in order to ensure the preservation of our planet. These include recycling, turing off the lights, and gererating less waste.
